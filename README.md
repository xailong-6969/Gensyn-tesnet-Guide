# RL-Swarm Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the `rl-swarm` project from scratch, including restoring a saved key, activating a virtual environment, running the service, and exposing it via a tunnel.

---

## **Steps**

### 1. Backup `swarm.pem`
Copy your key file to a safe location:
```bash
cp $HOME/rl-swarm/swarm.pem $HOME/
```

### 2. Clean and Clone Fresh Repo
Remove the old project and clone the fresh version:
```bash
rm -rf $HOME/rl-swarm
git clone https://github.com/xailong-6969/rl-swarm
```

### 3. Restore `swarm.pem`
Move the key file back into the cloned repo:
```bash
cp $HOME/swarm.pem $HOME/rl-swarm/
```

### 4. Navigate and Start Screen Session
```bash
cd $HOME/rl-swarm
screen -S gensyn
```

### 5. Set Up Python Environment
Inside the `screen` session:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
./run_rl_swarm.sh
```

Wait for the message:
```
Waiting for localhost:3000...
```

Then **detach** the screen session:
```bash
Ctrl + A, then press D
```

---

## **Expose Localhost Port (3000)**

### Option A: Using LocalTunnel
```bash
npm install -g localtunnel
lt --port 3000
```

### Option B: Using Cloudflare Tunnel (Cloudflared)
```bash
sudo apt install cloudflared  # or brew install cloudflared on macOS
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

Open the given URL in your browser and log in.

---

## **Restore Screen Session**
To return to your background screen session:
```bash
screen -r gensyn
```

---

**Done!** Youâ€™re now back in your `gensyn` screen and ready to interact with the running service.
